short-bio:
    # I started working as a research assistant for Johanna Schwarz (PhD), in a large sleep deprivation project, where I helped with data collection of more than 200 participants, analyzed results and wrote articles. This prepared me well for the PhD education, which I started in 2016. Working in the project also led me into the sleep research, and my main research focus is the effects of sleep deprivation on the interplay between emotion and cognition, which is also the subject of what was the first article of my dissertation. I recently finished my PhD and during the past two years I have started to work with magnetoencephalography (MEG) to understand neural underpinnings of effects of sleep deprivation. I am also interested in exploring selective attention processes using frequency tagging.

    I recently finishing my PhD in Psychology (Stockholm University) on the effects of sleep deprivation on emotional processing. Currently, I work as a postdoctoral researcher at Karolinska Institutet (KI) in Stockholm, Sweden. At the moment my time is split between two projects. One research project investigating neural representations of selective attention using MEG and frequency tagging. I also work within an EU-funded project to support small and medium-sized AI-companies test, evaluate and certificate their products for use in health care. The initiative is called TEF-health and the Swedish node consists of CIR (Centre for Imaging research, KI), SciLifeLab (KTH) and RISE [read more](https://news.ki.se/major-eu-funding-for-development-of-ai-in-healthcare).
