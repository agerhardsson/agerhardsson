## Work experience

`2023-`
**Work-package coordinator (50%):**
TEF-Health | Center for Imaging Research (CIR), Karolinska institutet

My role in this EU-funded project is to coordinate one of the most central work-packages *Use cases and Demonstrators*. Here we want to identify the most important health related challenges as defined by society and health care, and map these to the development of AI and robotics in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). End goal of the project is to create Testing and Experimentation facilities and support for SMEs to better meet the needs of the health care and society.

`2022-`
**Post-doc (50%):**
Karolinska institutet

In this project we investigate the neural underpinnings of multi-sensory selective attention using MEG and frequency tagging. The work entails methods development, recruitment and experimental testing of healthy volunteers. 

`2022-2023`
**Post-doc (50%):**
NatMEG, Karolinska institutet

Besides lab management and development of educational material I helped start the implementation of new optically pumped magnetometers (OPM).

`2016-2022`
**PhD Student:**
Department of Psychology, Stockholm university

The thesis included three published articles and one manuscript, all with me as the first author. During the last two years I planned, designed and ran an experimental sleep restriction study, which included magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of 33 participants, scanned twice.

`2021-2022`
**Research assistant (20-40%)**
NatMEG, Karolinska institutet

Responsible for general lab-maintenance, technical support, helium refill and Driver’s license training for using the Electa/MEGIN Triux 306 channel system.

`2014-2016`
**Research assistant (100%)**
Stress research institute, Stockholm university

Involved at all levels in a large research project (N = 218), engaged in setting up the experiments, writing test protocols, recruiting participants, collecting and analyzing data, and writing articles.

`2014`
**Research assistant (20%)**
Center of Neurodevelopmental Disorders at Karolinska Institutet
